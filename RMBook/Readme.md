<!-- # Hello, thank you for choosing us
# This library is for small word encryption.
# If you're looking for fast and scalable cryptography up to high sentence counts, check out the RRZ library on my GitHub page.
# https://github.com/whm-h
#
#
#
# To encrypt, you must use the following command
# RM.Lock(your_text , name = 'Custom_name_to_save_the_file_key_to_that_name' , Protocol = S1 Until S9)
# Protocol => Type of random encryption based on letters and numbers
# The higher the protocol number, the harder the encryption type and the longer it takes, choose from 1 to 10 encryption types according to your needs.
# The number after S is the encryption difficulty level
#
#
#
# To open the encryption, you must use the following command
# RM.Unlock(The name of the encrypted file)
# Before unlocking encryption, please put the encrypted file along with its key in the program folder -->
